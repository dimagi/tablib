Tablib is an :ref:`MIT Licensed <mit>` format-agnostic tabular dataset library, written in Python. It allows you to import, export, and manipulate tabular data sets. Advanced features include, segregation, dynamic columns, tags & filtering, and seamless format import & export.

I recommend you start with :ref:`Installation <install>`.
